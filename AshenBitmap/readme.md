# Ashen Bitmap
An Image format i created, that is designed to be easy to read.
refer to Specification.md to know how the files should be organized.

# About this subproject
its not just here to specify a format no one other than me is going to use; its actually a tool i wrote to convert several formats into this image format.

Command Line Arguments:

/o\<filename> - Specifies the output file, you don't need to add the extension .amp

# Building
Well, you'll need dub (just install a D compiler and it should already come with it)
and SDL2 in this case only SDL2_Image.
